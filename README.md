   For the first time in twenty-two years Thomas A. Edison has taken a real vacation. Starting on August 2nd by the ==Mauretania=={description="A region of northwestern Africa north of the Sahara."} with his son Charles, he went to England to join Mrs. Edison and their daughter Madeline and son Theodore for an automobile trip in Europe, returning to New York on October 7th. Believing that the readers of Popular Electricity Magazine would be interested in Mr. Edison's impressions of his foreign trip, a correspondent called upon him at his laboratory in Orange, New Jersey, and found the great inventor looking rugged and well, and although extremely busy, willing to grant an interview.
When asked to mention the most interesting experiences of his European trip, Mr. Edison smiled and said, "That's a large order, and I don't know that I can fill it, but let us begin at the beginning.
 
   "One of the first things I did on arriving in England was to visit the ==House of Commons=={description="The lower legislative house in the British parliament."} where they were holding an all night session and where I saw two votes taken on the Bill relating to the ==House of Lords=={description=" The upper legislative house in the British parliament."}. A seat was given to me in the ==Strangers' gallery=={"A place in the parliament building for guests to spectate."}. I could see, but, of course, could not hear the speeches. It was all very interesting but there was no excitement. After the House adjourned everyone went out on the Terrace, where I was introduced to a great number of the statesmen. They presented me with a copy of the Lords' Veto Bill signed by Prime Minister Asquith, ==Lloyd George=={"A Welsh statesman in the Liberal Party who would become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1916 to 1922, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time."}, ==John Redmond=={"An Irish nationalist statesman in the House of Commons at the time."}, ==John Burns=={"A trade unionist and socialist member of the Liberal Party who was the President of the Local Government Board at the time."}, ==T. P. O'Connor=={"Also an Irish nationalist statesman in the House of Commons."} and others. I was invited to visit the House of Lords the next day but could not spare the time as I had arranged to meet my wife in France.

   "Next to Americans the English have the best practical brains. I like the English and admire their institutions and statesmen, and the way the country is run. They are strong on ancient traditions, but they are fast realizing that mere hereditary institutions must go.

When I was in England a ==great railroad strike began=={"The national railway strike of 1911 was the first national strike of railway workers in Britain. It arose from longstanding disputes between workers and railway companies, combined with the desire of the unions to assert their unity and strength."}, but the Government realized that it had a duty to perform to stop disorder, and it acted firmly. Governments are merely huge business concerns, and no allowance for sentiment should be made in their practical dealings with the affairs of the world. In this case England took energetic measures to ensure the right of the individual to work for whatever wages he pleased, despite the tyranny of labor societies, and I think it is a healthy sign of her basic common sense.

"Motoring through France is a source of unbounded pleasure. I have seen no superior roads anywhere. I travelled over more than 2000 miles of roads there and less than three miles were bad. There was not a rut more than two inches deep. We are far behind the French in this respect, and our American road engineers can get some valuable pointers from France.

"I was disappointed, however, in Paris as the so-called City of Light. It bears no comparison to New York in that respect. The Champs Elysees, which is the most brilliantly illuminated street in the city, looks like twilight compared with Manhattan's 'Great White Way. Paris is ever a wonderful city. There is much to interest the visitor, and I took no small pleasure in revisiting the familiar scenes of years ago, but my stay in the city of magnificent prospects was very short.

I did not visit any of the great scientific Institutions, the purpose of my trip being to see the country. The historical monuments of Paris do not impress me. I see them resting on the bones of countless victims of Napoleon's personal glory. Conquest costs; it never pays. The Germans have ==paid more than a thousand dollars an acre for Alsace and Lorraine=={"The Franco-Prussian War, which started in July 1870, saw France defeated in May 1871 by the Kingdom of Prussia and other German states. The end of the war led to the unification of Germany. Otto von Bismarck annexed Alsace and northern Lorraine to the new German Empire in 1871."} and they thought they had gained it for free. Their little ==march around the Arch of Triumph=={"The Arc de Triomphe honors those who fought and died for France during the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, with the names of all French victories and generals inscribed on its inner and outer surfaces. The Germans marched around it during the Franco-Prussian War."} was in the end the costliest promenade ever made. The glory of the war lord, wherever he may be, is fading away. There is too much independent thought, too many--

--newspapers and schools in our present day of civilization to permit the antiquated methods of these overambitious men who, hiding behind their selfish arms, cry loudly for the glory of their country and force ruin on their people. The terrible price of war would be clear to coming generations if every monument had inscribed upon it the details of its cost to the people. The war game has received a solar plexus blow, anyhow, in the coming of the areoplane. A thousand aeroplanes would cost less than one ==Dreadnought=={"The dreadnought was the predominant type of battleship in the early 20th century."}, but think of the frightful effect of a fleet of a thousand airmen dropping ==nitro-glycerin bombs.=={"Nitroglycerin is an oily liquid that may explode when subjected to heat, shock, or flame. Alfred Nobel developed the use of nitroglycerin as a blasting explosive by mixing nitroglycerin with inert absorbents, particularly "Kieselgur", or diatomaceous earth. He named this explosive dynamite and patented it in 1867."} Another great international war in Europe seems impossible now so far as I can see. In other words, invention has gone beyond the thirst of blood; the power of science that has been let loose must overwhelm aggressive diplomacy. Although Europe has learned her economic lesson, the ==subject of war seems to be ever in the minds of her people.=={"World War I would start three years after his visit to Europe."}

"But returning to more pleasing subjects than war, let me say that I enjoyed my tour through France. Its beautiful scenery is restful, and its agricultural richness is very impressive. I was amazed at the beautiful crops of wheat, barley and other small grain. There were no such extensive fields of one kind of grain as we see in our western states, but cultivation is done in small acreages. A few acres of wheat, with a similar patch of oats adjoining it, and so on, but all in the highest state of perfection. The farmers are successful and well to do, and it was not difficult to discern one reason of the wealth of France. The vast vineyards were particularly interesting. Unfortunately it did not happen to be the time for gather-

--ing the grape crop. I would like to have seen it, for I understand they make a great holiday of the occasion.

"France is a nation of people who not only possess a high order of intelligence but they are shrewd and thrifty. Everywhere--

--we went on our motor tour we found the people apparently happy and contented. They have savings in plenty, but they put the money out in Government bonds. Land investments with them are practically nil. I was struck with the lack of new buildings going up. The peasants are certainly geniuses in making the most of a tiny strip of land. In one small farm I counted no less than seven different kinds of crops. The apple orchards of Normandy astonished me by their wonderful crops of ruddy apples as fine as the best we have. The French bread struck me as particularly good. It was palatable and nutritious and I ate a great deal of it while in the country.

The French are wiser than we in not seeking to make their bread dazzlingly white by sacrificing the nutritive parts of the wheat. Their skill in cooking is apparent everywhere, for even in the smallest villages everything that was served had the magic of their art. Switzerland is a country of magnificent scenery and practically unlimited power going to waste. In motoring it is quite a change to leave the beautiful French roads where one can speed and get into Switzerland where sixteen miles an hour is the limit. The people are progressive but lack the daring in business that is characteristic of the ==Anglo-Saxon.=={"Here Thomas Edison is referring to the ethnicity of the English or English-descended Americans."} They are hampered by over-prudence. In some respects they remind me of the Japanese, for their genius shows itself in minute sorts of labor. They are a little people in a little land. As far as I can judge, they are more intricate in invention than in mind. Their watches, clocks, music boxes, wooden toys, and whatnot-- everything is little. We showed them how to make Geneva watches by machinery, and now they are imitating us in their own country. But occasionally a great engineer will arise among them. One is my friend Turitini, who constructed the great power works on the Rhone.

"Cheap electricity is waking up Switzerland, and there are some signs of growth. You will find new buildings going up, which cannot be said of all the countries in Europe. It is to be hoped. that the Swiss will soon be so thoroughly awakened that the dreadful spectacle of women harnessed to the plows, yoke-mates with cattle will be a thing of the past.

"==Bohemia=={"Bohemia was the historical name of the modern-day Czech Republic, and during 1911 it was a territory within Austria-Hungary."} was a surprise to me. I had not expected to find much progress there but was agreeably disappointed. New construction was in evidence not only in the larger towns, but even the smaller towns are extending somewhat. Most of the old houses are built up to the sidewalks and there are no gardens or lawns in front, but the modern houses are different, and one sees flowers in the front yards. Perhaps this may be due to the influence of Bohemians who have returned to their country with a competence made in America, and have taken American ideas with them. There is a general tendency in Bohemia toward commercial and manufactur- ing development on a larger scale than ever before. Many factories are in course of construction. But the country is at present handicapped by ill-feeling between the laity and the Church, which must work itself out before any great progress can be made. I was struck with the fact, here, as elsewhere, that the European farmer makes more out of less promising land than ours by intensive farming. Over there they spend their time and energy in carefully cultivating small areas instead of crudely cultivating--

# Page 8

.ve-media https://edisondigital.rutgers.edu/iiif/MM009 seq=8 left

--large areas as many of our farmers do. Nothing in the way of land goes to waste in Europe. Even the roadside is lined with fruit trees, principally apples, then come pass, then cherries. Ninety-nine percent of such land goes to waste with us. The Bohemians grow great crops of apples. There must be at least 250 square miles of the country devoted to apple growing. Their fruit is not as good as ours, however, being smaller and mostly used for the manufacture of champagne, vinegar, etc.

"In travelling through France I found myself looking always for the nation's factories but generally in vain. Of course, she has her factories and plenty of them, but her manufactures, generally speaking, are artistic in nature, high in value and small in bulk. Hence, they do not require large machinery to produce them. On coming into Germany one immediately sees evidence of its being a great industrial nation. I saw more factory chimneys in the town of ==Chemnitz=={"Chemnitz is one of the most important centres of German industrial culture as the country's first factories were built there."} alone than in the whole of France.

"It seems like a humiliating thing to say, but it is the fact that Germany's manufacturing industries are pushing ahead much faster than ours are. The growth of her manufactures is constant and tremendous.

"Thousands of factories are in course of construction. I saw many factories in North Germany, and whether they were built or in building, the construction generally speaking was better than the construction of the best of ours. Their building methods are extremely sensible, economical and effective. They use cement more freely and more wisely than we do. One sees everywhere buildings of loose stones faced with cement which fills in the interstices.

"Every detail of factory construction over there is hedged about by carefully restrictive laws which are rigidly enforced. The consequence is well built buildings, safe, sanitary admirable. There is very little danger of fire in such buildings. I was told in ==Prague=={"The capital of Bohemia and modern-day Czech Republic."} that the city's fire loss in one year was only ==$26.=={"In 2023, that amount comes to just $823."} The fire horrors which are continually occurring in America are impossible. The construction of the buildings is such that the workmen's health is carefully protected; they have fine light and air, and in the arrangement and management of the machinery they are carefully protected against accident. We have many things to learn from Germany in these details of factory equipment, construction and management.

"When our American people realize that the average depreciation on an average building--

# Page 10

.ve-media https://edisondigital.rutgers.edu/iiif/MM009 seq=10 left

--is 3 per cent as against one-half of one per cent in Germany, they will wake up and throw aside tradition and take a lesson from our German friends who make liberal use of cement as a building material. We are apt to think of them as being slow and conservative. They are certainly conservative, but in that respect they have ==forged ahead and made haste economically.=={"For example, by 1913, the German electricity production was higher than the combined electricity production of Britain, France, Italy and Sweden."} 

"Germany is up to date in all branches of mechanical and scientific advance. She is not behind us in these lines, generally speaking, although her shops are full of American machinery or imitations of it. I went through two great electrical shops in which 85 per cent of their machinery was American. This illustrates the good sense of the Germans. While Germany is the most scientific of all the nations, she does not approach us in applied science. She is pre-eminent, however, in some lines. In chemical industries ==she stands alone.=={"Imperial Germany built up the world's largest chemical industry. The production of German chemical industry was 60% higher than that of the United States."} But, here, again, her checmical laboratories and factories are full of American machinery. In automatic labor-saving devices of all kinds and in their application we excel her.

"The Germans are the world's most persistent people. They usually get what they are after, and they have started now to capture our mechanical prestige. If the United States is to prevent them from outstripping us in the race, we shall have to get down to hard, intelligent work.
"The German domestic trade is enormous, but from indications in the packing rooms of several large German factories which I visited, I should say their foreign trade is still larger. They are organizers of great ability and extraordinary--

--patience and are wonderfully energetic and intelligent. Not only are they fighting us for the world's trade, but they are also fighting Engiand wherever she has business that they want, and they have engaged in a ==persistent campaign for the world's business.=={"In 1913, Germany produced almost 90% of the world supply of dyestuffs and sold about 80% of their production abroad."} This campaign is not sensational, but there is no slackening up of it. If we are going to hold our own or win out, we should watch them closely, for there is much in their methods that we--

# Page 12

--could learn with profit.

"They have gone so far as to establish banks with German capital in all parts of the world for the purpose of assisting resident German merchants, thus Germany not only exports goods and makes the profit from their sale abroad, but furnishes the necessary banking facilities, also highly profitable, through which the business is conducted. 

"Another thing in Germany impressed me greatly, and that is one great advantage which their manufacturers have over us and every other country. I refer to her great promoting banks. In our country a man desiring to put something new on the market must have a promoter of his enterprise, and our promoters are notoriously irresponsible. In Germany inventions are brought out by the promoting banks.

"For instance, The Deutsche Bank, which is one of the largest banks in the world, has a corps of engineers and auditors ready to investigate any proposition. An invention is taken to them. If after most careful investigation it proves likely to be useful and profitable, the money to push it is forthcoming. The financial and technical investigation is rigid, but if the idea stands that test, the capital is ready. 

"A manufacturer wishes to extend his business can get money promptly at a reasonable interest if he can prove that his proposed-extension will be profitable. It saves time and keeps him out of the clutches of sharks. 

"A good part of this plan is that the bank will carefully watch the progress of the invention the manufacturer, and will place the stock on the Exchange, and when it--

# Page 13

has arrived at a certain point of prosperity, will take its money back, charging only a fair profit for its use. This leaves the inventor or the manufacturer with his invention and factory in his own hands to proceed alone without encumbrance. This shows the wisdom that the Germans exercise in providing the utmost ==encouragement to their inventors and manufacturers,=={"Germany invested more heavily than the British in research, especially in chemistry, ICE engines and electricity. Germany's dominance in physics and chemistry was such that one-third of all Nobel Prizes went to German inventors and researchers."} and I predict that it will soon put the German Nation in advance of us in the origination and development of new mechanical ideas.

"I believe I see the true inwardness of the Emperor's ==unwavering naval policy.=={"German expenditure on ships was steadily rising. In 1907, 290 million marks was spent on the fleet, rising to 347 million marks or 24 percent of the national budget in 1908, with a predicted budget deficit of 500 million marks. By the outbreak of World War I, one billion marks had been added to Germany's national debt because of naval expenditures."} He does not want war; no one wants it less. But he apparently considers a large navy a good business investment. It insures protection to German capital invested in the remote parts of the world, as well as to German merchants wherever they may be. Hence their navy may be looked upon as a commercial proposition, and its cost as insurance premium.

"My visit to Berlin was exceedingly interesting. I had not been there for twenty-three years, and the city had grown almost beyond my recognition. It has been called the ==Chicago of Europe=={"Mark Twain called Berlin the Chicago of Europe in an article originally published in the Chicago Tribune in 1892. They were both fast-growing cities which were experiencing new construction that set them apart from their neighbors."} and it is certainly growing with Chicago speed. I have good reason to be interested in Berlin, for it is the center of electrical industry in Europe. The greatest of the electrical works, the ==Allgemeine Elektricitäts Gesellschaft,=={"AEG was one of the world's largest electrical companies. The company was founded in Berlin in 1883 by Emil Rathenau as the German Edison Society for Applied Electricity, and was renamed Allgemeine Elektricität-Gesellschaft in 1888. In addition to products for electrical energy technology and household needs, the company also manufactured devices for electric building heating, trams, electric and steam locomotives as well as motor vehicles."} is there, and is operated under the direction of my old friend Emil Rathenau, employing about 60,000 workmen. I feel a sort of paternal interest in this work as it was practically started by me, and once bore my name.

"Another of the great electrical works in Berlin is owned by another of my old friends, Sigmund Bergmann. He started his electrical life with me by working at the bench in my Newark shop about forty years ago, and later on made carbon transmitter telephones and phonographs, and afterwards became my partner in manufacturing the detail apparatus for the electric light system. His shrewdness and ability kept him ahead of the procession in this country, and he has kept up his reputation by organizing and operating his great establishment in Berlin, where he employs about 12,000 workmen and makes everything electrical.

"Still another of the great electrical shops is the one established by Schuckert, who also worked at the bench in my Newark shop with Bergmann, leaving my employ to go to Germany to settle up his father's estate. He stayed there and took up the manufacture of electrical apparatus and established the great works that bear his name, and in which many thousands of workmen are employed. He died immensely wealthy, but the works still go on.

"I was much impressed with the great progress Germany is making in electrical manufactures and in the use of electricity. The people use electric light with great liberality, for they can buy current very cheaply. I was told electric light is used so very universally that they light cow stables and pig styes with it, and electric current applied to a vast number of purposes, even to grain fields for the propagation of nitrogen.

The people use electric light and power with great liberality, for they can buy current very cheaply. While there are many important manufacturing plants throughout the country, Berlin is distinctly the electrical center. The importance of the ==electrical industry=={"In 1895, Berlin replaced its horse-drawn trams with electric vehicles. In the years leading up to the First World War, electric trams became the dominant means of public transport in the German capital and other major cities. About five per cent of Berlin’s homes boasted electric power in 1914, this figure had risen to 25% eleven years later and to 50% by the end of the decade."} to Berlin may be readily appreciated when it is realized that at least one-sixth of that city's population is directly or indirectly dependent upon it for support. 

"I found my trip through Europe most interesting and instructive. It was made mostly by motor car, so we really saw the countries we went through, and really came in closer contact with the people who live in them than if we had travelled from place to place by train. I am well satisfied, however, to get back to my own country, for I did not see any country on the other side of the ocean that can compare with the United States, if considered as a whole.
