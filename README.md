   For the first time in twenty-two years Thomas A. Edison has taken a real vacation. Starting on August 2nd by the Mauretania with his son Charles, he went to England to join Mrs. Edison and their daughter Madeline and son Theodore for an automobile trip in Europe, returning to New York on October 7th. Believing that the readers of Popular Electricity Magazine would be interested in Mr. Edison's impressions of his foreign trip, a correspondent called upon him at his laboratory in Orange, New Jersey, and found the great inventor looking rugged and well, and although extremely busy, willing to grant an interview.
When asked to mention the most interesting experiences of his European trip, Mr. Edison smiled and said, "That's a large order, and I don't know that I can fill it, but let us begin at the beginning.
 
   "One of the first things I did on arriving in England was to visit the House of Commons where they were holding an all night session and where I saw two votes taken on the Bill relating to the House of Lords. A seat was given to me in the Strangers' gallery. I could see, but, of course, could not hear the speeches. It was all very interesting but there was no excitement. After the House adjourned everyone went out on the Terrace, where I was introduced to a great number of the statesmen. They presented me with a copy of the Lords' Veto Bill signed by Prime Minister Asquith, Lloyd George, John Redmond, John Burns, T. P. O'Connor and others. I was invited to visit the House of Lords the next day but could not spare the time as I had arranged to meet my wife in France.

   "Next to Americans the English have the best practical brains. I like the English and admire their institutions and statesmen, and the way the country is run. They are strong on ancient traditions, but they are fast realizing that mere hereditary institutions must go.
